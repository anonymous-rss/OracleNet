Performance trends with variable dataset and network sizes
----------------------------------------------------------

To analyze the learning capabilities of OracleNet, we performed experiments on environment 'Difficult 2' (refer to Fig. 5 in the paper) with variable dataset and network sizes. Success rates and path optimality (benchmarked against A*) are used to measure performance trends.
